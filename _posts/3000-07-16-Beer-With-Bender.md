<h3> Today I traveled to the future. NBD or anything</h3>
<p> I had some spare time so I took a quick trip to the year 3000. .... I know... haveing spare time as a time traveler doesn't quite make sense, seeing that time doesn't really matter much since I can manipulate it. But I digres....

Once I arrived in the year 3000, I realized I hadn't had a drink in almost 1000 years (i crack myself up), so I headed to the bar for a futuristic refersher.



I'm in the future!!! What did I do today.... I'm pretty sure I found Bender and had a beer. You'll never guess who came and sat next to me at the bar, but to save us both the time in you not guessing correctly, it was Bender!

Of course, we both got smashed and trashed the place. I narrowly escaped the future before getting hauled off to jail. I promised Bender I'd make arrangements to get us out of the mess via my time-skills... but I'm le tired. May be later. He'll never know the difference.</p>
